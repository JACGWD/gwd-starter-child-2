# GWD Child Theme Images Folder

Please place the image files your CSS stylesheet requires in this folder. 

For best performance, only use well optimized images (for example by using ImageOptim for Mac: https://imageoptim.com/mac, as well as it's Windows and Linux counterparts: https://imageoptim.com/versions.html ).

Please also make sure to resize your images to the **size needed in your mockups X 2**. For example, if the image in your mockup is 400px wide, please save an 800px image in this folder.

The extra resolution image will be served to high pixel density displays (aka "retina dispolays"). Wordpress will resize the other images requires for other devices as needed.

## Avoid PNGs 
Most PNG files are excessively heavy. In most cases, you will achieve much better compression results by saving your images as JPEG.



## SVGs

It is recommended to use SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) as often as possible as they have small file sizes and can render beautifully at (almost) any size. 



## SVGs from the web can be **dangerous**

Please only use SVGs you created yourself in Illustrator. Since SVGs are code, they can easily be hacked. DO NOT USE RANDOM SVG IMAGES FROM THE WEB.

If you must use SVGs from a third party source (for example social media icons) please only upload them to Wordpress by using the **Safe SVG** plugin (available from https://wordpress.org/plugins/safe-svg/). It's job is to delete any unsafe code.

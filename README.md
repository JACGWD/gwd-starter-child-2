# gwd-starter-child
 Child theme for users of the GWD Starter WordPress Theme

Even though the GWD Starter Theme is indeed a "starter", it is still being developed. Getting students to use a child theme based on it will safeguard the student's work and make sure that any fixes to the original theme do not disrupt the student's files.
